## Kard Ma Profile Cards 🧘🏻

This is an app that allows the user to create a digital cards with their full name, position and links to their contact details and social network profiles.

The peculiarity of the application is that we worked with heritage code and migrate code from javascript to React.

We are a team of five women from very different backgrounds that came together through Adalab Bootcamp in Madrid and this is our project.

We received the following design,

but we felt we wanted to improve the project by adding a extra value: a meaningful design: Karma Profile Cards. Make some funny conexion between KardMa, profile cards and the yoga master Bette Calman.
